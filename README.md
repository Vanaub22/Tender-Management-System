# Tender Management System

This is the Beta Version of the Tender Management System which I had to prepare as a part of my **Software Engineering Course** **(ESC501)** in my **3rd Year (5th Semester)** of **B.Tech** in **CSE**.

Tech used:

 - **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap-4
 - **Back-End:** Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite3

The project is still in its nascent stage and runs only on a Virtual Environment on the local host.

## The steps to start this project are as follows (For Windows Machines Only):

 1. Install VS Code and import all necessary dependencies, packages etc.
 2. Open Terminal in VS Code and type: `protender\Scripts\activate.bat` to launch the Virtual Environment.
 3. After that simply type in `python
    run.py` in the terminal.
